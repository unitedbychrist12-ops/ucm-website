## NEW HONEST MESSAGING STRATEGY

*"80% of your donation goes directly to program services - addiction counseling, housing assistance, job training, and spiritual support. The remaining 20% covers essential operational costs including licensed professional staff (doctors, nurses, counselors), facility maintenance, and administrative expenses. This 80/20 split represents excellent stewardship - most nonprofits operate with 25-35% overhead."*

### **WHY THIS IS BETTER:**
✅ **Builds Trust** - Donors appreciate honesty about operations
✅ **Shows Professionalism** - Demonstrates you understand nonprofit management
✅ **Attracts Major Donors** - Sophisticated donors prefer transparency
✅ **Prevents Issues** - No misleading claims that could cause problems later
