## VOLUNTEER SCRIPTS AND APPROACHES

### RESIDENTIAL DOOR-TO-DOOR SCRIPT

**Opening (Warm and Professional):**
*"Hi, I'm [Name], and I'm a volunteer with United by Christ Ministries here in [City]. We're a local nonprofit that helps people overcome addiction and find stable housing. Do you have just a minute to hear about the work we're doing in our community?"*

**Mission Presentation:**
*"UCM operates a comprehensive program that helps people struggling with addiction, homelessness, and life challenges. We provide housing, addiction counseling, job training, and spiritual support. Last year alone, we helped over 500 people get back on their feet and reunite with their families."*

**Donation Request (Primary Goal):**
*"We rely on community support to fund these life-changing programs. Would you be willing to make a donation to help us continue this work? Even $25 can provide meals for someone for three days, and $100 can fund a week of housing assistance."*

**Service Referral (Secondary Option):**
*"I completely understand if a donation isn't possible right now. We also have a community partnership that might help you save money on your monthly bills. Would you be interested in learning how you could reduce your internet, phone, or energy costs? When community members use these services, a portion goes back to support our programs, so you'd still be helping while saving money."*

**Closing:**
*"Thank you so much for your time and for caring about our community. Here's my card with UCM's information. Please keep us in your prayers, and don't hesitate to reach out if you or someone you know ever needs our help."*

### BUSINESS OUTREACH SCRIPT

**Professional Introduction:**
*"Good morning, I'm [Name], a volunteer with United by Christ Ministries. We're a local 501(c)(3) nonprofit focused on addiction recovery and housing assistance. I'm reaching out to local businesses about partnership opportunities that benefit both our community and your business."*

**Business Value Proposition:**
*"UCM has helped over 500 people in our area overcome addiction and find stable housing. We're looking for business partners who want to make a real impact in our community while also benefiting from tax-deductible donations and positive community recognition."*

**Partnership Options:**
*"We have several ways businesses can partner with us - from one-time donations to ongoing sponsorships to employee giving programs. We also have a unique partnership that can help your business reduce operating costs on services like internet, merchant processing, and energy while supporting our mission."*

**Decision Process:**
*"Would you be interested in learning more about how your business could partner with UCM? I can provide detailed information about our programs, tax benefits, and cost-saving opportunities. What would work best for your schedule?"*

### OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

**"I don't have money to donate"**
*"I completely understand - times are tight for everyone. That's actually why I wanted to mention our cost-saving partnership. We work with a community partner that helps families and businesses reduce their monthly bills on internet, phones, and energy. Many people save $50-200 monthly, and a portion of those savings supports our programs. Would you like to see how much you might be able to save?"*

**"I already give to other charities"**
*"That's wonderful - thank you for supporting charitable work in our community. UCM focuses specifically on addiction recovery and homelessness right here in [City], so we're addressing issues that directly affect our local area. Even a small donation makes a big difference, or you might be interested in our cost-saving services that help you support our mission without additional expense."*

**"I don't support religious organizations"**
*"I appreciate your honesty. While UCM is faith-based, we serve people of all backgrounds and beliefs. Our programs focus on practical help - housing, job training, addiction counseling - regardless of someone's religious views. We believe everyone deserves a second chance and the support they need to rebuild their lives."*

**"I'm not interested"**
*"I understand, and I appreciate your time. Here's our information in case you ever want to learn more about our work or if you know someone who might need our services. Thank you for listening, and have a great day."*
