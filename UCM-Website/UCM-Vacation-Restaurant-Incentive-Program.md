## UPDATED AI SCRIPT FOR GRACE

### **NEW DONATION REQUEST WITH INCENTIVES**

**Primary Donation Ask:**
*"We rely entirely on community support to fund these life-changing programs. As a thank you for your generosity, we have some special appreciation gifts available. For a $100 donation, you'll receive a restaurant marketing package worth over $500 that you can use for any restaurant in the state of your choice. For a $250 donation, you'll receive a weekend getaway package worth over $1,000 to a destination you select."*

**Value Emphasis:**
*"So not only are you helping transform lives through our addiction recovery programs, but you're also receiving valuable benefits for yourself or your business. It's our way of saying thank you for caring about our community."*

**Choice & Control:**
*"You can choose any state for your restaurant marketing package, or select from over 20 destinations for the vacation package. Which option sounds more appealing to you?"*

### **OBJECTION HANDLING WITH INCENTIVES**

**"I don't have money to donate"**
*"I completely understand, and that's exactly why we created these appreciation packages. The restaurant marketing package alone is worth $500+ in services. So your $100 donation actually gives you $500 in value while helping someone overcome addiction. You're essentially getting $400 in free marketing services while supporting a great cause."*

**"That sounds too good to be true"**
*"I understand your caution, and that's a smart question. These packages are provided through our community partnerships with travel and marketing companies who support our mission. They donate these services to help us raise funds. You'll receive all the details and booking information immediately after your donation."*

**"I already give to other charities"**
*"That's wonderful, and this is different from typical charitable giving. You're receiving immediate, tangible value for your donation. Many of our supporters use the restaurant marketing packages for their businesses or enjoy the vacation packages with their families. It's charitable giving that actually benefits you directly."*
