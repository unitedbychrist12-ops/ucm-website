# UCM 501(c)(3) COMPLIANCE GUIDE FOR R SAVE PARTNERSHIP
*Protecting UCM's Tax-Exempt Status While Maximizing Fundraising*

## CRITICAL COMPLIANCE FINDINGS

### 🚨 **MAJOR RED FLAGS TO AVOID**

**1. PERCENTAGE-BASED FUNDRAISING COMPENSATION**
- **IRS Rule:** "It is NOT appropriate for a nonprofit to compensate a fundraising professional based on a percentage of the money raised"
- **Risk:** Could jeopardize UCM's 501(c)(3) status
- **Solution:** Use salary-based compensation for UCM fundraising activities

**2. PRIVATE BENEFIT VIOLATIONS**
- **IRS Rule:** No part of net earnings can benefit private individuals
- **Risk:** R Save profits benefiting you personally while using UCM name
- **Solution:** Clear separation between UCM and R Save activities

**3. SUBSTANTIAL NON-EXEMPT PURPOSE**
- **IRS Rule:** Must operate "exclusively" for charitable purposes
- **Risk:** Commercial activities becoming primary focus
- **Solution:** Keep UCM's charitable mission as primary purpose

## BOTTOM LINE RECOMMENDATIONS

### **SAFEST APPROACH:**
1. **Keep UCM and R Save completely separate**
2. **UCM promotes R Save as community partner**
3. **R Save donates based on referral tracking**
4. **No shared employees or commission structures**

### **MODERATE RISK APPROACH:**
1. **UCM hires salaried outreach staff**
2. **Staff focus on education and referrals**
3. **R Save handles all sales and commissions**
4. **Clear documentation of separate roles**

### **YOUR DECISION:**
Given UCM's importance to your mission and the potential risks, I recommend the **SAFEST APPROACH** with complete separation. This protects UCM's 501(c)(3) status while still allowing significant fundraising through the partnership.

**The key is keeping UCM's charitable mission primary while R Save operates as a separate for-profit entity that supports UCM through donations.**
