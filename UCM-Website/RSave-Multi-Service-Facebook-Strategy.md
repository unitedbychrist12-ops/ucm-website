## FACEBOOK AD SATURATION SOLUTION

### **THE PROBLEM WITH SOLAR ADS:**
- **Oversaturated market** - hundreds of solar companies
- **High competition** = expensive clicks ($5-15 per click)
- **Ad fatigue** - people ignore solar ads
- **Facebook restrictions** - stricter policies on solar

### **R SAVE MULTI-SERVICE ADVANTAGE:**

**Instead of:** "Get Solar Installation"
**We say:** "Save Money on Home & Business Services"

**Services Offered:**
- ✅ High-speed internet (save $50+/month)
- ✅ Solar installation (eliminate electric bill)
- ✅ Cell phone plans (save $30+/month)
- ✅ Merchant processing (save 30-50% on fees)
- ✅ Roofing services (insurance claims)

**Why This Works:**
- **Less competition** in multi-service space
- **Lower ad costs** - not competing with solar-only companies
- **Higher conversion** - more options = more appeal
- **Broader audience** - everyone needs internet/phones
