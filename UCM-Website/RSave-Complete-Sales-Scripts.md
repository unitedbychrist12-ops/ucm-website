## OBJECTION HANDLING

### **COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES**

**"I'm happy with my current provider"**
*"That's great to hear! Most of our clients were happy with their service too - they just weren't happy with the price they were paying for it. Even if you're satisfied with your current service, wouldn't you be interested in getting the same quality for 30-50% less? It's the same networks, just at wholesale rates."*

**"I don't have time for this"**
*"I completely understand - time is valuable. That's exactly why I keep this simple. Our specialist can come by at your convenience, show you the exact savings in 15 minutes, and if it makes sense, handle the entire switch for you. You don't have to do anything except save money."*

**"I'm locked into a contract"**
*"That's actually pretty common. Most contracts have early termination fees, but in many cases, the monthly savings are so significant that even paying the termination fee, you come out ahead within 2-3 months. Let me have our specialist calculate the exact numbers for your situation."*

**"I need to think about it"**
*"Absolutely, this is a business decision that deserves consideration. What specifically would you like to think about? Is it the savings amount, the service quality, or something else? Maybe I can address those concerns right now."*

**"I need to talk to my partner/spouse"**
*"Of course, that makes perfect sense. Would it be helpful if our specialist met with both of you together? That way you can both see the numbers and ask any questions you might have."*

**"How do I know this is legitimate?"**
*"Great question - you should always verify before making changes. We're a licensed business with an A+ BBB rating. All our partner providers are major national companies you'd recognize. I can provide references from other local customers, and our specialist brings all credentials and documentation when they visit."*

**"I've been burned by companies like this before"**
*"I'm sorry to hear that, and I understand your caution. That's exactly why we do things differently. We provide a detailed cost comparison upfront, use only established national providers, and offer a satisfaction guarantee. If you're not saving money within 60 days, we'll help you switch back at no cost."*
