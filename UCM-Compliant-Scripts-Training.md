Do you have a minute to learn about some resources that might help you save money on your monthly bills?"*

**Educational Focus:**

**Business Value Proposition:**
*"We work with local businesses to help them reduce costs on internet, merchant services, and other expenses. Many businesses save $200-500 monthly, and a portion of those savings supports our nonprofit programs helping families with addiction and housing challenges."*

**Professional Referral:**
*"I'd like to connect you with our community partner who specializes in business cost reduction. They can provide a free analysis of your current expenses and show you potential savings. Would that be helpful?"*
